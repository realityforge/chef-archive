## v0.2.8:

* Makes the permissions on the container directory configurable by adding a mode attribute in the
  LWRP. This will apply to the top level container directory, e.g. /usr/local/myapp and the version
  subdirectories /usr/local/myapp/versions and /usr/local/myapp/versions/x.x.x.

  retrieving the values through the methods on the resource.

* Stop backing up deleted files.
* Support file:// urls.
