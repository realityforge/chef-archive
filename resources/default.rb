# The LWRP retrieves an artifact of particular version from a url. The artifact is
# placed in a versioned directory and then a symlink is created from current version
# of the artifact to the retrieved version.

# The LWRP first creates a container directory based on the name and the prefix. Under the
# container directory, there is a directory in which all the versions of the artifact are
# stored. The LWRP will download the artifact and place it in this directory and then symlink
# the "current" directory to the downloaded artifact.

# By default the LWRP will retain the directory for the last artifact downloaded.

# @action add Download and extract archive.

# @section Examples

#     # Download the myapp.zip archive, extract the archive, strip the
#     # top level dir and place results into /usr/local/myapp/versions/1.0
#     # and symlink /usr/local/myapp/versions/current to /usr/local/myapp/versions/1.0
#     archive 'myapp' do
#       url "http://example.com/myapp.zip"
#       version '1.0'
#       owner 'myapp'
#       group 'myapp'
#       extract_action 'unzip_and_strip_dir'
#     end

#     # Download the myapp.zip archive, extract the archive, strip the
#     # top level dir and place results into /usr/loca/myapp/versions/1.0
#     # and symlink /usr/local/myapp/versions/current to /usr/local/myapp/versions/1.0
#     # and set the permissions of /usr/local/myapp to 0755
#     archive 'myapp' do
#       url "http://example.com/myapp.zip"
#       version '1.0'
#       owner 'myapp'
#       group 'myapp'
#       mode '0755'
#       extract_action 'unzip_and_strip_dir'
#     end

#     # Download the myapp.jar and place set the attribute
#     # myapp.home_dir to the container dir (i.e. /usr/local/myapp) and
#     # myapp.jar_location to the downloaded jar. (i.e. /usr/local/myapp/pkg/current/myapp-1.0.jar)
#     archive 'myapp' do
